# Game Description

This is a generic game of SuperPacMan. Your goal is to gather the diamonds, eat yummy cherries, flee from the ghosts and break out of the maze. Keep an eye out for the shiny coins, they may be of great help to fend off ghosts.

# Controls

- Control your player using the arrows on your keyboard; just like any other ARPG. It is very intuitive.

- At any moment you may pause your game by pressing the button 'P'. To revert the state, simply press 'P' again.

- When in the main screen or the game over screen, follow the instructions that appear on screen to proceed.

**Note**: When given an orientation to move in, PacMan keeps on moving until he bumps into a wall, or until the user decides to change his direction of movement. It is an intended mechanic of the game!
